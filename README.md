# Bankist Marketing - Advanced DOM Manipulation and Event Handling

This project is part of Jonas Schmedtmann's course, where I mastered advanced DOM manipulation techniques and efficient event handling practices to create highly interactive and dynamic web applications.

Features
DOM Manipulation:
Modal Windows: Display overlays for user interactions by dynamically toggling classes.

Smooth Scrolling: Navigate seamlessly to sections using JavaScriptâ€™s scrollIntoView().

Tabbed Components: Dynamically switch content panels on user interaction.

Lazy Loading Images: Enhance performance by deferring image loading until they appear in the viewport.

Reveal Sections: Use the Intersection Observer API to animate sections as they enter the viewport.

Event Handling:
Efficient Delegation: Attach event handlers to parent elements (e.g., navigation bar) to optimize performance.

Menu Fade Animation: Create interactive hover effects for navigation links and logo.

Keyboard Accessibility: Handle keydown events to improve usability (e.g., navigation slider control).

Slider Implementation: Enable content transitions using button clicks and keyboard input.

Sticky Navigation: Use the Intersection Observer API for dynamic sticky behavior based on scroll position.

This project deepened my understanding of:

Efficient DOM Traversal and Manipulation: Using modern JavaScript methods to dynamically update the DOM.

Event Listeners and Delegation: How to attach and manage events efficiently using delegation.

Intersection Observer API: Enhancing performance by observing changes to elements.

Lazy Loading for Performance: Using data-src attributes to load images only when needed.

Keyboard Accessibility: Creating responsive and user-friendly apps with keyboard controls.
